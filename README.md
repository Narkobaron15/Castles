# Castles

## Description
"Castles" is an exciting physics-based puzzle game developed in Unity. Players take on the role of a medieval siege engineer, tasked with toppling enemy fortifications using a variety of projectiles and siege weapons.

## Gameplay
- Launch projectiles from your trebuchet to destroy enemy castles
- Aim carefully and adjust your power to hit weak points in the structures
- Use different types of ammunition (rocks, fireballs, explosive barrels) for varying effects
- Progress through increasingly complex levels with more challenging castle designs
- Earn stars based on your efficiency in demolishing each castle

## Features
- Realistic physics simulation for destruction and projectile trajectories
- Multiple ammunition types with unique properties
- Diverse castle designs with different materials (wood, stone, metal)
- Progressive difficulty curve with new mechanics introduced over time
- Colorful, medieval-themed graphics and sound effects

## Technical Details
- Developed using Unity
- C# scripting for game logic and mechanics
- Utilizes Unity's built-in physics engine for realistic destruction
